# Best Episodes of the Distractible Podcast
(This is the only thing I could think of)

## What is Distractible?
Distractible is a podcast started in 2021 by *"Mark Fischbach, Wade Barnes, and Bob Muyskens,"* better known as **Markiplier**, 
LordMinion777, and Muyskerm. I would hope everyone knows at least one of those names. I hesitate to call it a comedy podcast,
even though it definitely is, since that somehow makes it sound less funny.

### Rules
Distractible (to start off) didn't have many rules. The host of an episode can pick any topic to discuss or game to play, and the 
other 2 have to compete to earn points. The person with the most points at the end of the episode hosts the next one.
During the episode *The Council of Distractible*, when they all 3 won the previous episode, they added a ton of rules which they
then updated in *The Council of Distractible (Part 2)*. I've already spent too long explaining, so you'll have to watch those 
episodes from the list.

### Catagories
I'm splitting this up into 4 catagories, the first 2 being audio and video, since they made a deal to have video exclusive to Spotify 
in 2023 (**It is now on YouTube too**). The episodes are usually good to watch or listen to, but after the point where video was 
added, some of them need to be watched to get the full experience. The next 2 catagories are post *Council of Distractible*, and 
post *Council of Distractible (Part 2)* due to the massive additions to the rules, and the changes made to them in part 2. 

### Note
This list doesn't include some episodes that are important for references. For example, probably the one that comes up the most, the
episode *The Worst Piece of Sh\*t Episode Ever* where Bob's topic is "We're getting older," which he had just used a few episodes
earlier, and none of them noticed until the end. The circumstance of the episode? Very funny. The actual episode? Not that funny.

I will also make note of when I remember an episode making use heavy use of AI. In the case of at least the first one, the "AI" they
were using was before AI was anywhere near as advanced as it is now. Back when it was all just so insane that it was funny.

One last thing, the contents of some episodes might not be SFW, I didn't have time to watch every episode for this.
